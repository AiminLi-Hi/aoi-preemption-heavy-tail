## Overview

This repository provides MATLAB code for reproducing the main numerical results in:

We study a continuous-time joint sampling & preemption problem under general (possibly heavy-tailed) service-time distributions. The system is formulated as a **PDMP impulse control** problem. By using an **integral average-cost dynamic programming principle**, the resulting coupled ACOEs reduce the busy-phase preemption decision to an **optimal stopping** problem, enabling fast **average-cost policy iteration** tailored to heavy tails (Pareto/Lomax and log-normal).

## Key Features

- Continuous-time joint **sampling + preemption** with explicit sampling/preemption penalties
- **Integral ACOE** formulation (avoids smoothness assumptions of average-cost HJB–QVI)
- Busy-phase invariance ⇒ **one-dimensional boundary** ⇒ **optimal-stopping preemption**
- Efficient **policy iteration** designed for heavy-tailed delays
- Experiments under **Pareto (Lomax)** and **log-normal** service times

## Quickstart

Run the MATLAB scripts below to generate the main simulation outputs:

- `Paretov2.m` — experiments under Pareto (Lomax) service times  
- `lognormal.m` — experiments under log-normal service times  

Tip: For reproducibility, keep the default parameter settings unless you are intentionally sweeping a specific regime.


Additional helper functions (if included) are called by the main scripts; please keep relative paths unchanged.
